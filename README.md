## Awesome Raise 3D almost any control\! \[FIXED\]


</div>

### Description

Holy cow! This is awesome! This actually works. You can make almost any object or control in VB6 have a raised 3D affect. You have to check this out. You have to try it. And you have to help me improve it please. If you make any improvements, please re-upload it thanks. there aren't any comments in the code. I just threw it together. There is an example of how to use the True3D module. If you use the code, you have to just make copies of frmLines. that is where all the lines reside. This is why we need to make this better and easier to use. All forms were included in the previous upload. Just the project didn't load it for some reason. You could have manually added the frmLines after opening the project or you can re-download this updated project.
